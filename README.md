Mac Commander
==========

A plugin for the Indigo home automation system (http://indigodomo.com)

This plugin allows you to perform actions on any Mac in your network, whether it is the Indigo server or not.  What you can do is only limited to what Applescript can do on the given machine.

At its core this plugin is a Python program that executes Applescript commands on your desired machine.  While this is easily accomplished using Indigo's scripting, I wanted to be able to take it a step further by having an On/Off state associated with the command.
